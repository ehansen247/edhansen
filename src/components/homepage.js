                <p> Hi, I'm Eric, a sophomore at Harvard College studying Computer Science and
                    and Applied Math. If you'd like to see a portfolio of my programming projects,
                    feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/ehansen247">GitHub</a>, or
                    the descriptions and links under the Projects tab on this site.
                    Outside of programming, my interests include being a part of
                    the <a href="https://www.gocrimson.com/sports/sailing/index">Harvard Varsity Sailing Team</a> and
                    the <a href="http://business.thecrimson.com/">Crimson Business Board</a>.
                    I'll be studying Computer Science along with Mathematics, Statistics,
                    and Economics over the next three years.
                </p>
