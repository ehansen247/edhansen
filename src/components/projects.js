                    <p> I developed Inspire during my freshman summer to build an accessible database of
                        inspirational quotes. In part, I took on this project because I wanted to learn how to 
                        integrate an SQL database, NodeJs backend, and Angular frontend in the 
                        same project. Along the way, I decided to include a daily inspirational quote, and
                        the ability for users to create an account and store their own personal quotes.
